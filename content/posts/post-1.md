## Introduction
This blog post series: **Kruemels Bug Bounty Odyssey** will be about my journey, becoming a (decent) bug bounty hunter.

My main reasons to share this journey publicly:
* Keep myself accountable - set goals, commit to them and execute, without excuses!
* Share knowledge with the community - without free resources most of us would not be where we are now!
* Provoke feedback from the community - if I publish something it's to my best knowledge, if you know better, please let me know!

## Main goal

The main goal of this journey is simple: **Get 100k in rewards**  

... to join the 100k club known from the likes of NahamSec (https://x.com/NahamSec) and Rhynorater (https://x.com/Rhynorater).

As this goal is pretty far fetched, I will not define it in more detail. But I'll set SMART goals for each quarter of the year and on a weekly base (weekly goals will be documented in this series) to adjust to the given personal circumstances.

**100k in rewards is not a sprint, it's a marathon and I will achieve it step by step in a sustainable way!**

## Weekly goals - CW 5

**NahamSec** mentioned in one of his videos that the first two big steps on someones bug bounty journey are getting 1k in rewards and then 10k in rewards:

1k - Proof yourself you can find bugs  
10k - Proof yourself you can repeatedly find bugs

I could identify myself with this a lot, that means my first goal is to simply find a bug/bugs worth 1k in rewards. I will try to blend out everything else, not thinking about complex bug classes, scaling, automation or anything else.

As I can't put a time frame on that it's not a real SMART goal, but the following goals are SMART and will lead me to achieve my first 1k in rewards and enable me to document it properly!

### SMART goals - CW 5
- [ ] 35 hours focused work on this project (blog and hunting)
- [ ] Finalize blog setup (Domain and deployment pipeline)
- [ ] Define and execute a simple approach to find the first bug(s)
- [ ] Publish second blog post
- [ ] Write first X post
